A place where I'm trying to understand transformers deeply and explore concepts in mechanistic interpretability, by using the [Othello World](https://github.com/likenneth/othello_world) dataset. I've reimplimented much of their dataset code (simplifying greatly), and relied on Neel Nanda's Transformer [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo_Template.ipynb) and Andrej Karparthy's (GPT Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY].

To get started:

`pip install -e .` 

in the root directory will install the project and its dependencies.
